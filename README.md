# TrainInventory
This is an inventory app that I made for the train collection of my husband and sons. It also became my practice project for a long while. It uses MVVM architecture with Room, Dagger2, Paging3, Navigation, Coroutines, Flows and Data Binding. Application has the feature to export sql database to excel file. Icons on the action menu are animated vector drawables that I designed in ShapeShifter.

Some fragments were soo much similar that I (probably over)used inheritance.

The repo contains lots of integration tests and also unit tests and it uses Github Actions for Continuous Integration.
